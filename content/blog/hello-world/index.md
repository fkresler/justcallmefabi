## Hello world

Hey there,

if you are a developer you are probably aware of `Hello World`. Usually this little piece of text marks the beginning of a lifetime journey for many upcoming developers. In the same manner it represents the start of my personal journey in a different way: my own page in the world wide web where I can share my learnings, shortcomings, experiments or weird and cool stuff in general (mostly cool tho!).

The actual first time I have written my first `Hello World` was about 13 years ago when I got myself a book about C/C++. And albeit I started it and finished my `Hello World` exercise I never completed reading the whole thing. It event went so far that I had to focus on school and completely abandoned programming for quite a while. But back then I knew I wanted to continue learning about it because to me the idea of having a cool idea and being able to getting it to work on my own sounded like a dream come true to me.

So after school I started studying it in university and learnt a lot about different subjects and categories of programming. In the end I decided that web development sounds the most interesting for me. Sometimes you are taking errands but you are getting back to it. In the same way I got back to programming and so I am writing down my very own first `Hello World` again just in a different manner and am getting a little bit nostalgic.

## Who am I today

I was born in Germany and to this day I am still german. As of writing this I was living 29 years (yes, that is my whole life) in Franconia in a small village and I enjoy living my small life here.
There is a lot of green throughout the region and I enjoy best taking a walk through the numerous forests here while sinking into my thoughts.
Other than that I try to keep contact to the few people I consider close friends and whenever possible manage to spent time with them I will do so.

- studied computer science and have been working in a e-commerce business since then
- my daily business work: inhouse developed e-commerce platform based on React
- I'm more of a green person, I love nature and animals, animals should be free and I care about the future of our planet
- Started playing guitar this year and practice often, not really good but one of my dreams is a small campfire with friends singing classic songs to the soundds of guitar
- Othern than that I also enjoy gaming with or without buddies, mostly playing Destiny 2 and Legends of Runeterra, sometimes also singleplayer games, I enjoy the storytelling: it feels like experiencing the story and really being part in it instead of just watching
- some private projects influenced by gaming:
  - Destiny raid planner Discord bot
  - Destiny to-do list, routine planer and organizer
  - Legends of Runeterra quiz

## My personal goals with this

- documenting learnings
- continue growing
- more knowledge width with depth in specific topics: mostly React-based, starting with Svelte and Vue
- experimental implementations
- sorting and classifying thoughts
- practicing written and spoken English
- providing a way to become aquainted with my skillset and my way of working and solving problems
- giving something back to other devs because they did the same for me

## What kind of content can you expect?

- Project progress with workflows/implementations
- Random experiments
- random learnings on deep topics
- if you are interested in something, feel free to ask

## What is your role in this?

- If I managed to do something cool, feel free to try it and show it!
- Honesty
- Please give feedback, negativ or positive, I'm glad about it all the same
- If you read this, thank you
