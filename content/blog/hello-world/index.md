## Hello world

Hey there,

if you are a developer you are probably aware of `Hello World`. Usually this little piece of text marks the beginning of a lifetime journey for many upcoming developers. In the same manner it represents the start of my personal journey in a different way: my own page in the world wide web where I can share my learnings, shortcomings, experiments or weird and cool stuff in general (mostly cool tho!).

The actual first time I have written my first `Hello World` was about 13 years ago when I got myself a book about C/C++. And albeit I started it and finished my `Hello World` exercise I never completed reading the whole thing. It event went so far that I had to focus on school and completely abandoned programming for quite a while. But back then I knew I wanted to continue learning about it because to me the idea of having a cool idea and being able to getting it to work on my own sounded like a dream come true to me.

So after secondary school I started studying it in university and learnt a lot about different subjects and categories of programming. In the end I decided that web development sounds the most interesting for me. Sometimes you are taking errands but you are getting back to it. In the same way I got back to programming and so I am writing down my very own first `Hello World` again just in a different manner and am getting a little bit nostalgic since a lot has changed since back then.

## About me

I was born in Germany and to this day am still german. As of writing this I have been living 29 years (yes, that is my whole life) in Franconia in a village and I enjoy living my small life here.
There is a lot of green throughout the region and I enjoy best taking a walk through the numerous forests here while sinking into my thoughts.
Other than that I try to keep contact to the few people I consider close friends and whenever possible manage to spent time with them I will do so.

- studied computer science and have been working in a e-commerce business since then
- my daily business work: inhouse developed e-commerce platform based on React

- More extraordinary UI interactions and experiments, e.g. CSS art, animations
- Video editing
- Othern than that I also enjoy gaming with or without buddies, mostly playing Destiny 2 and Legends of Runeterra, sometimes also singleplayer games, I enjoy the storytelling: it feels like experiencing the story and really being part in it instead of just watching
- some private projects influenced by gaming:
  - Destiny raid planner Discord bot
  - Destiny to-do list, routine planer and organizer
  - Legends of Runeterra quiz
- Practicing guitar

## My personal goals with this

- documenting learnings
- continue growing
- more knowledge width with depth in specific topics: mostly React-based, starting with Svelte and Vue
- experimental implementations
- sorting and classifying thoughts
- practicing written and spoken English
- providing a way to become aquainted with my skillset and my way of working and solving problems
- giving something back to other devs because they did the same for me

What kind of content can you expect?

- Writing in general
- Project progress with workflows/implementations
- Random experiments
- random learnings on deep topics
- if you are interested in something, feel free to ask

## What about you?

At the beginning of this post I mentioned that this will be the start of my adventure. And like anything you first have to learn and get better at it before it starts getting really good. But you have to start. Everybody started somewhere.

I don't expect you to bear with me, that's just how things go. People want to read the things they are interested in because everybody only has so much time. But if I managed to do something cool or inspired you to try something I'd be honored if you tell me about it or even better show it off! Also I appreciate all sorts of feedback: positive AND negative! While positive feedback reassures I might be doing things right I can only improve things when you tell me what you don't like!

If you have read this far there is only one thing left to say: THANK YOU! This is your time and you decided to bear with me and i cannot appreciate that enough. I will try my best to get some interesting stuff out there.

So long,

Fabi
