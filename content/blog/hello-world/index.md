## Hello world

Hey there,

if you are a developer you are probably aware of `Hello World`. Usually this little piece of text marks the beginning of a lifetime journey for many upcoming developers. In the same manner it represents the start of my personal journey in a different way: my own page in the world wide web where I can share my learnings, shortcomings, experiments or weird and cool stuff in general (preferably cool I hope).

The actual first time I have written my first `Hello World` was about 13 years ago when I got myself a book about C/C++. And albeit I started it and finished my `Hello World` exercise I never completed reading the whole thing. It event went so far that I had to focus on school and completely abandoned programming for quite a while. But back then I knew I wanted to continue learning about it because to me the idea of having a cool idea and being able to getting it to work on my own sounded like a dream come true to me.

So after secondary school I started studying it in university and learnt a lot about different subjects and categories of programming. In the end I decided that web development sounds the most interesting for me. Sometimes you are taking errands but you are getting back to it. In the same way I got back to programming and so I am writing down my very own first `Hello World` again just in a different manner and am getting a little bit nostalgic since a lot has changed since back then.

## About me

I was born in Germany and have been living here in a village in Franconia for 29 years as of writing this (yes, that is my whole life). It is a small life but I enjoy it. There is a lot of green throughout the region and I relish taking a walk through the numerous forests here while sinking into my thoughts.
I have met a lot of great people here and to some of them I am still holding close contact to this day and whenever possible I will spend time with them.

And there is a trend here: after finishing my bachelor degree in computer science in a close university here I also started to work not too far away. So since a little bit over 4 years I have now been working in an e-commerce business that develops and operates the online shops of a few online brands. Sometimes there are external workers travelling into this region for a business trip and they cannot believe that in a region like this businesses are actually working in a modern stack with React in the frontend and hosting their application in the cloud.

In my daily job I am primarily focusing on the my account and checkout area and if you are experienced with UX you probably are aware that in those sections the primary focus is on functionality and simplicity. That also means there is not much room for extraordinary implementations. And this is actually what I want to get more into and learn and do more of.

I am already trying to compensate for that by starting side projects on my own. Usually I am basing them on which games I am currently playing. The one that is the most polished is actually a project based on the game League of Legends I called [myfavoriteleague](https://myfavoriteleague.web.app/). Up to this point it is probably the most polished one I have put some time into. Some other side projects I am working on are:

- Destiny 2 Discord bot for easier raid organization in a clan
- Destiny 2 routine planner to keep track of the current goals and objectives
- Legends of Runeterra quiz

## My personal goals with this

I am not starting a blog just because I feel like it but rather I have some ulterior motives why I want to write more. I could just write this down for myself but at the same time I thought I could make it publicly as well. It might just happen that you stumble upon this blog casually or intentionally and get something out of it and if that happens to just one single person I consider that as objective accomplished. So why am I doing this outside of hoping someone out there gets something out of this:

- Have you ever thought to yourself "I already did this some time ago but cannot remember how I solved it and why I did it this way"?. I most certainly did. So whenever I learn something interesting while coding or fixing things I feel the urge to document it because chances are I will need this again some time in the future. Also on a blog you can use as many words as you want to describe your intentions and how you actually got there.
- Before starting this I have heard a lot about the ecosystem and plethora of options out there in the Javascript world and just like with my other side projects I want to gather some experience with different frameworks so I can argue about using specific ones and their ideas and differences down the line in the future.
- I am not coding much stuff outside of my comfort zone. I feel like I can do basic CSS stuff for example and understand flex-box relatively well but on the other side I am not confident with animations or even transitions. I cannot do that in my daily job so I want to include that in side projects. And when I learn about new things and do cool stuff I want to talk (or write) about it so others can also get something out of it as well.
- I also want to improve sorting and classifying my thoughts because I feel I am not very good in doing that. Writing more will help me improve in that because when writing you will need to start of with a plan starting from stating a problem/idea/solution and then going into different side topics to put it into perspective in the whole picture. It is kind of art how to convey information to other people as efficiently as possible while keeping it understandable and providing as much context as necessary. I believe in writing being the first step in that process and will make an impact into doing it verbally automatically.
- Depending on where you are living in Germany you will need to make use of English as a language on different levels if at all. Often I make use of English by reading other blogs or books online but mostly that is about understanding and not speaking English on my own. Sometimes I have to talk English while playing video games but that is not sufficient to be able to speak English proficiently and keep English speaking skills at a proficient level. Guess what? When writing a blog in English I need to state my thoughts in English! More practice is always welcome.

## What about you?

At the beginning of this post I mentioned that this will be the start of my adventure. And like anything you first have to learn and get better at it before it starts getting really good. But you have to start. Everybody started somewhere.

I don't expect you to bear with me, that's just how things go. People want to read the things they are interested in because everybody only has so much time. But if I managed to do something cool or inspired you to try something I'd be honored if you tell me about it or even better show it off! Also I appreciate all sorts of feedback: positive AND negative! While positive feedback reassures I might be doing things right I can only improve things when you tell me what you don't like!

If you have read this far there is only one thing left to say: THANK YOU! This is your time and you decided to bear with me and i cannot appreciate that enough. I will try my best to get some interesting stuff out there.

So long,

Fabi
